Write a program that calculates the kinetic energy of an object for a mass provided by the user and the following speeds: 1.0 m&nbsp;s$^{−1}$, 2.0 m&nbsp;s$^{−1}$, 3.0 m&nbsp;s$^{−1}$, 4.0 m&nbsp;s$^{−1}$.\n",

The programs will also be made available in a folder named SOLUTIONS in the OCL. These programs will be released close to the end of the study week, in order to encourage you to find your own solutions before seeing them.)"
