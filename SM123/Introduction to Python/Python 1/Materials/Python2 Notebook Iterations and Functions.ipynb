    "In the physics problem that the code in Section 1.2 of Notebook 1 addresses, the total mass comprises the sum of the various masses of the individual items in the shopping basket. But, you can write a program to sum those individual masses to obtain the total mass, from which the weight will be calculated. The algorithm (which is independent of any programming language) is as follows.\n",

    "To explain the code, in Python, **lists** are simply comma-separated values, within square brackets […].\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```for variable in list: block``` instruction goes through the given list (in this case <code>items</code>, which contains the mass of each item in the shopping basket) and successively stores each value of the list in the variable <code>item</code>, and then executes the block, which will usually (but not always, see the exercise below) use the value of the variable in some way. This means that the value of `item` is different on each pass through of the code block, going through each element of the list `items` in turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that the block is indicated by the indentation. Of course, you don't have to call the list items or call the variable that steps through the list item. You could define the list to be ```b=[1.45,2.6,0.25,4.4,1.9]``` and then write ```for a in b:``` where <code>a</code> is the variable that steps through the list, and then change the next line to read ```totmass=totmass+a```, and so on. However, as noted before, it's usually best to use variable names that are meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in plain English: this program will take the first value in the list <code>items</code> (i.e. 1.45), store it in the variable <code>item</code> and then add <code>item</code> to the current value of the variable <code>totmass</code> and store the result again in <code>totmass</code>, so that it is always up to date. In other words: let the new total mass be the old total mass plus the mass of the next item in the basket. Then it will do the same for the second value in the list, and so on until there are no more elements in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that before starting to add up the masses, <code>totmass</code> is set to zero. This is good practice, as it makes sure only the masses listed in <code>items</code> contribute to the final value of <code>totmass</code>. (Setting an initial value for a variable is called (variable) **initialisation**.). Note also the effect of the floating point number error  on the final output. As explained `Python1.Notebook1_Introduction` notebook this can be ignored."
