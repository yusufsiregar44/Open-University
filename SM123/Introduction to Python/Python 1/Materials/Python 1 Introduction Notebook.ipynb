    "# 1 Introduction to Python\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<p>Coding (or programming) is the construction of software. Coding involves writing a ‘recipe’, which in computing is called an algorithm, in a programming language that a computer can understand. When the computer runs the code, it follows the ‘recipe’, step by step. Knowledge of coding is a vital tool for any physical scientist to acquire and is a skill used daily by many practising scientists. Each programming language has its own syntax and commands, but the approach to coding is general. The skills, concepts and jargon (in boldface) you will learn are the foundations for coding in all sorts of languages for all sorts of uses: from apps to software that controls industrial machinery to weather forecasting codes and the like.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>In this topic, you will use Python, a programming language that is popular for teaching and for professional software development. You will see that Python code reads almost like plain English. Writing simple programs in Python is not very difficult, once you have come up with the ‘recipe’: the algorithm.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>This topic shows you how to code in Python using the basic building blocks of all algorithms, and how to ask the user for input and produce some output on the screen. In what follows, I will show you several small programs, with further exercises for you to practice your coding skills by modifying or building upon my programs.</p>\n",

You may edit these lines and add or change them as you wish. The output of the program will appear below the cell when it is run, and is also where the user may type an input into the program when prompted to do so."

We could call the variable anything we want, such as <code>R</code> or <code>sum_of_two_numbers</code>, but the first of these is rather too short to be meaningful, and the second is rather long to type in.

Notice that you do not need to use complete words for variable names, but it’s best to use a name that at least reminds you of what the variable represents.

The 1 on the 15th decimal place is due to what is called 'floating-point error'. It is caused by the way in which decimal numbers are saved in binary. It is basically a rounding error caused going between the binary numbers in memory and the decimal numbers displayed to the user. Obviously a 1 part in a million billion (which is what the 15th decimal place represents) does not affect the result here but there are experiments in science where it could have an impact and so alternative calculation methods must be employed. The only impact here is that our result does not print nicely. We will discuss rounding and/or displaying outputs without these errors at another time.\n",

    "The code provides incorrect results. If you set latitude to values smaller than 30$^{\\circ}$, it will not use the acceleration value of 9.78 ms$^{−2}$. The reason is that the code will encounter the first <code>if</code> condition (```if latitude < 60```) and, because 30$^{\\circ}$&nbsp;< &nbsp;60$^{\\circ}$, it will set <code>acc = 9.81</code>&nbsp;m s$^{−2}$.
